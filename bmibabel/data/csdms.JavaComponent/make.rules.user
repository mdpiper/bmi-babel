# The following targets are reserved to bocca:

#    debug, .gencode, .msg, .PHONY

# All user defined variables should be prefixed with something project
# related. We will dispatch to the following user-defined targets.

# The user may extend our set of phony targets by defining USER_PHONY in make.vars.user.
